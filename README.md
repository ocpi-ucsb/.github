# Welcome to the OCPI Github organization

Our lab designs, fabricates, tests, and integrates photonic devices and systems in silicon nitride. These devices leverage the low optical loss of silicon nitride to realize novel functionality such as ultra-high-Q waveguide resonators, narrow linewidth on-chip laser sources, and photonic molecules. We demonstrate these devices operating at the system scale in applications ranging from atomic-referenced metrology, to low power, ultra-high-capacity optical communications for tomorrowâ€™s energy efficient hyperscale data centers.
